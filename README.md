# retail_sales-analysis-in-sql
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to uncover key business insights, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making. Using real-world retail datasets, the goal is to understand sales performance, customer behavior, seasonal patterns, and profitability across regions and product categories.

ðŸ§  My Analysis & Findings â€” SQL Sales Analysis Project

This project explores sales and customer transaction data using SQL to extract meaningful business insights.
Each query focuses on a specific analytical objective â€” from basic data retrieval to advanced aggregations.
Below are the questions, approaches, and the insights derived from each one.

Q1. Retrieve all sales made on â€˜2022-11-05â€™

Query Objective:
To display complete transaction details for all sales made on a specific date â€” 2022-11-05.

Purpose & Insight:
This helps identify the total number of orders and product categories sold on a given day.
Itâ€™s often used for daily performance tracking, holiday sales, or campaign analysis.

Q2. Retrieve all transactions where the category is â€˜Clothingâ€™ and the quantity sold is more than 10 in Nov-2022

Query Objective:
To find all high-volume clothing transactions made during November 2022.

Purpose & Insight:
This reveals bulk buyers or promotional spikes in sales.
It can help the marketing team target frequent clothing customers during festive or sale seasons.

Q3. Calculate the total sales for each category

Query Objective:
To compute the total sales revenue generated by each product category using aggregation (SUM(total_sale)).

Purpose & Insight:
This helps understand which categories are performing well (e.g., Grocery > Clothing > Beauty).
Itâ€™s a key part of category-wise revenue comparison and helps optimize inventory planning.

Q4. Find the average age of customers who purchased items from the â€˜Beautyâ€™ category

Query Objective:
To analyze the age demographics of customers interested in Beauty products.

Purpose & Insight:
Reveals whether the Beauty segment appeals more to younger or older customers, guiding targeted marketing and campaign design.
For example, an average customer age of 27 indicates a young adult audience.

Q5. Find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000

Query Objective:
To filter out high-value transactions (premium sales).

Purpose & Insight:
These are big-ticket customers contributing more to revenue.
They can be targeted for loyalty programs, personalized discounts, or premium delivery offers.

Q6. Find the total number of transactions made by each gender in each category

Query Objective:
To perform a two-dimensional grouping by gender and category to understand gender-based purchasing trends.

Purpose & Insight:
Identifies patterns like:

Females buying more in Clothing or Beauty

Males buying more in Electronics or Sports
Useful for personalized marketing and recommendations.

Q7. Calculate the average sale for each month and find the best-selling month in each year

Query Objective:
To compute the monthly average sales using GROUP BY month and determine the best-performing months per year.

Purpose & Insight:
Shows seasonal trends (e.g., high sales during festive seasons like Diwali or Christmas).
Helps plan inventory stocking, marketing campaigns, and discount strategies.

Q8. Find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales

Query Objective:
To rank customers by total sales using ORDER BY SUM(total_sale) DESC LIMIT 5.

Purpose & Insight:
Highlights top-performing customers who bring maximum revenue.
Can be used to reward loyal customers or analyze purchasing behavior of top spenders.

Q9. Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category

Query Objective:
To count the distinct customers per category using COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id).

Purpose & Insight:
Helps understand category reach and customer diversity.
A higher number of unique customers indicates broad market appeal, while lower numbers suggest niche interest.

Q10. Create shifts and find the number of orders per shift (Morning â‰¤12, Afternoon 12â€“17, Evening >17)

Query Objective:
To categorize transactions into time-based shifts and count orders within each period.

Purpose & Insight:
Useful for operational optimization and resource planning.
Example insight:

Morning (â‰¤12): 35% of daily orders

Afternoon (12â€“17): 45% of daily orders

Evening (>17): 20% of daily orders

This indicates peak hours for staffing, logistics, and delivery scheduling.




ðŸ§¾ Conclusion

Through these SQL queries, I explored real-world retail data to uncover insights into customer behavior, seasonal trends, and revenue performance.
The project demonstrates strong SQL proficiency â€” including use of:

GROUP BY, JOIN, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Conditional filtering using CASE WHEN and date-based logic

Analytical storytelling using business-driven questions

This project shows how data-driven SQL analysis can support marketing, operations, and strategic decision-making in retail and e-commerce environments.
